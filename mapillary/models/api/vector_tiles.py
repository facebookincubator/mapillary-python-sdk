mapillary.models.api.vector_tiles

This module contains the Adapter design for the Vector Tiles API of Mapillary APIv4, Vector tiles 
provide an easy way to visualize vast amounts of data. Mapillary APIs are heavily based on vector
tiles to provide the developers with flexibility to programmatically interact with the data they
contain in custom ways. Vector tiles support filtering and querying rendered features. Mapillary
vector tiles follow the Mapbox tile specification.
